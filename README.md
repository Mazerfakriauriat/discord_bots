# My discord bots

Here are my discord bots, which I wrote in Python. Bots know English only in the console. Otherwise, they are Russian (because I'm from Russia. And besides, I'm 14).
The purpose of their creation is to prove to friends that I will HACK their Discord servers :)

If you know Russian, you can invite them to your server (until I write a program for them to hack)

Run through the console. If you open the file, it won't work

Don't forget to install discord.py as well
